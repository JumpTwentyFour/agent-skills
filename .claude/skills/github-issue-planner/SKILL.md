    Plan and create GitHub issues with structured requirements, acceptance criteria, and task breakdowns. Use when users want to: (1) create a GitHub issue, (2) plan a feature or epic, (3) report a bug, (4) break down work into tasks. Triggers include "create an issue", "plan a feature", "I found a bug", "let's plan this epic".

# GitHub Issue Planner

Plan issues collaboratively, then create them in GitHub using `gh` CLI.

## Workflow

### 1. Determine Issue Type

Ask if not obvious from context:
- **Bug** - Something broken or not working as expected
- **Feature** - New functionality or enhancement
- **Task** - Internal task or chore
- **Epic** - Large initiative requiring multiple child issues

#### Big Task Detection

Before creating an issue, evaluate whether the request is a "big task" that should be an Epic with subtasks. A task qualifies as big if it has:

- **Multiple distinct components** - The work involves several separate features or pieces
- **Cross-cutting concerns** - Requires work across different areas (frontend, backend, database)
- **Extended scope** - Would take more than a few days to complete
- **Multiple acceptance criteria** - Has several user stories or distinct outcomes
- **System-wide impact** - Affects multiple parts of the codebase

When a big task is detected, follow the Epic Creation Workflow below instead of creating a single issue.

### 2. Gather Requirements

Ask targeted questions based on type:

**Bug:**
- What's happening vs what should happen?
- Steps to reproduce?
- Environment details?

**Feature:**
- Who is this for and what problem does it solve?
- What does "done" look like?
- Any constraints or dependencies?

**Task**
- What needs to be done?
- What does "done" look like?

**Epic:**
- What's the high-level goal?
- What are the major milestones?
- What's explicitly out of scope?

Keep questions minimal—gather just enough to write a clear issue.

### 3. Draft the Issue

Use templates from [references/templates.md](references/templates.md).

Present the draft to the user:
```
Here's the draft issue:

**Title:** [title]

[body content]

---
Ready to create this in GitHub?
```

### 4. Create in GitHub

After user confirms, create with `gh`:

```bash
gh issue create --title "Title here" --body "Body here"
```

For epics, create the parent issue first, then offer to create child issues that reference it.


#### Title Standards
- **Sentence case** - Capitalise only the first word and proper nouns.
- **No type prefixes** - Use GitHub issue types, not Bug:, Feature: etc...
- **Imperative mood for enhancements** - "Fix N+1 issue" not "Fixing N+1 issue"
- **Descriptive for bugs** - Describe the symptom "Failed to allocate booking to staff member"
- **Specific** - "Be specific, it must be understandable without opening the issue body"

## Notes

- Always show the draft before creating
- For epics, confirm which child issues to create
- If `gh` isn't authenticated, tell user to run `gh auth login`
- Never include "Generated with Claude Code"
- Never use title case for descriptions - use sentence case
- **Always follow the Label Management Process** - See [references/labels.md](references/labels.md) for available labels and the process to check/create/apply them
- Map priority to urgency labels: P1=Critical, P2=High, P3=Medium, P4=Low
